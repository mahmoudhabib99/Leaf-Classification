# Leaf-Classification
In this project, you will use the Leaf Classification dataset using a neural 
network architecture. 
Download the data file, load it
Describe the data
Clean the data 
Check the data for missing values or duplicates and carry out proper correction methods
Visualize the data using proper visualization methods. 
Draw some of the images 
Carry out required correlation analysis
Divide the data into a training and test set using approximately 80% for training.  
Encode the labels

Part II: Training a neural network
Applying training function and exploring the following hyperparameter settings:

• Batch size: Number of examples per training iteration. 

• Hidden size: Try using different number of hidden nodes in your model and compare the performances. 

• Dropout is an effective strategy to defend against overfitting. Adding a dropout layer after the hidden layer, and try using different dropout rate to compare the performances. 

• Optimizer: Try using different optimizers such as SGD, Adam, RMSProp,Adagrad . 

• Regularization (weight decay): L2 regularization can be specified by setting the weight_decay parameter in optimizer. Try using different regularization factor and check the performance.
